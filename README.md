# pursuit-evasion-problem

## Abstract
Pursuit and evasion conflicts represent challenging problems with important applications in aerospace and robotics. In pursuit-evasion problems, synthesis of intelligent actions must consider the adversaryâ€™s potential strategies. Differential game theory provides an adequate framework to analyze possible outcomes of the conflict without assuming particular behaviors by the opponent. This work is concerned with a Minimum-Time Intercept Problem (MTIP), for which a Dubins vehicle is guided from a position with a prescribed initial orientation angle to intercept a moving target in minimum time. Moreover, the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) algorithm  (source: https://keras.io/examples/rl/ddpg_pendulum/) is applied. 

The main purpose of the work is to study the behavior of a neural network for the pursuit-evasion problem and to check whether the DDPG algorithm can be used to find solutions to differential games. To evaluate the operation of the algorithm, a comparison is made with the analytical solution obtained in this article https://link.springer.com/article/10.1134/S0005117921050015
